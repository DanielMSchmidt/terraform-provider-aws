import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_sfn_state_machine.DataAwsSfnStateMachine(self, "example",
            name="an_example_sfn_name"
        )
```

## Argument Reference
