import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_aws_api_gateway_rest_api_my_rest_api =
        aws.data_aws_api_gateway_rest_api.DataAwsApiGatewayRestApi(self, "my_rest_api",

        )
        aws.data_aws_api_gateway_resource.DataAwsApiGatewayResource(self, "my_resource",
