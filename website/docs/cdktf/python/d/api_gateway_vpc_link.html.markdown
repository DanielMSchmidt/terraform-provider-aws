# Data Source: aws_api_gateway_vpc_link

Use this data source to get the id of a VPC Link in
API Gateway. To fetch the VPC Link you must provide a name to match against.
As there is no unique name constraint on API Gateway VPC Links this data source will
error if there is more than one match.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_api_gateway_vpc_link.DataAwsApiGatewayVpcLink(self, "my_api_gateway_vpc_link",
            name="my-vpc-link"
        )
```
