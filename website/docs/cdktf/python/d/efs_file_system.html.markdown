# Data Source: aws_efs_file_system

Provides information about an Elastic File System (EFS) File System.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
        #     You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables
        file_system_id = cdktf.TerraformVariable(self, "file_system_id",
            default="",
            type=cdktf.VariableType.STRING
        )
        aws.data_aws_efs_file_system.DataAwsEfsFileSystem(self, "by_id",
            file_system_id=file_system_id.string_value
        )
        aws.data_aws_efs_file_system.DataAwsEfsFileSystem(self, "by_tag",
            tags={
                "Environment": "dev"
            }
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `file_system_id` - (Optional) ID that identifies the file system (e.g., fs-ccfc0d65).
* `creation_token` - (Optional) Restricts the list to the file system with this creation token.
* `tags` - (Optional) Restricts the list to the file system with these tags.

## Attributes Reference
