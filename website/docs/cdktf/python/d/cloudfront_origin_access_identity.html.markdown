# Data Source: aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity

Use this data source to retrieve information for an Amazon CloudFront origin access identity.

## Example Usage

The following example below creates a CloudFront origin access identity.

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity.DataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentity(self, "example",
            id="EDFDVBD632BHDS5"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `id` (Required) -  The identifier for the distribution. For example: `EDFDVBD632BHDS5`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `caller_reference` - Internal value used by CloudFront to allow future
   updates to the origin access identity.
* `cloudfront_access_identity_path` - A shortcut to the full path for the
   origin access identity to use in CloudFront, see below.
* `comment` - An optional comment for the origin access identity.
* `etag` - Current version of the origin access identity's information.
   For example: `E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`.
* `iam_arn` - Pre-generated ARN for use in S3 bucket policies (see below).
   Example: `arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity
 E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`.
* `s3_canonical_user_id` - The Amazon S3 canonical user ID for the origin
   access identity, which you use when giving the origin access identity read
   permission to an object in Amazon S3.
