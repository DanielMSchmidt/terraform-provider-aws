# Data Source: aws_appmesh_mesh

The App Mesh Mesh data source allows details of an App Mesh Mesh to be retrieved by its name and optionally the mesh_owner.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_appmesh_mesh.DataAwsAppmeshMesh(self, "simple",
            name="simpleapp"
        )
```

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_aws_caller_identity_current =
        aws.data_aws_caller_identity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(self, "current")
        aws.data_aws_appmesh_mesh.DataAwsAppmeshMesh(self, "simple",
            mesh_owner=cdktf.Token.as_string(data_aws_caller_identity_current.account_id),
            name="simpleapp"
        )
```
