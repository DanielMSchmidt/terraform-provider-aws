# Data Source: aws_ses_domain_identity

Retrieve the SES domain identity

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_ses_domain_identity.DataAwsSesDomainIdentity(self, "example",
            domain="example.com"
        )
```

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of the domain identity.
* `domain` - Name of the domain
* `verification_token` - Code which when added to the domain as a TXT record will signal to SES that the owner of the domain has authorized SES to act on their behalf.
