# Data Source: aws_licensemanager_grants

This resource can be used to get a set of license grant ARNs matching a filter.

## Example Usage

The following shows getting all license grant ARNs granted to your account.

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_aws_caller_identity_current =
        aws.data_aws_caller_identity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(self, "current")
        aws.data_aws_licensemanager_grants.DataAwsLicensemanagerGrants(self, "test",
            filter=[DataAwsLicensemanagerGrantsFilter(
                name="GranteePrincipalARN",
                values=["arn:aws:iam::${" + data_aws_caller_identity_current.account_id + "}:root"
                ]
            )
            ]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListReceivedGrants.html#API_ListReceivedGrants_RequestSyntax).
  For example, if filtering using `ProductSKU`, use:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_licensemanager_grants.DataAwsLicensemanagerGrants(self, "selected",
            filter=[DataAwsLicensemanagerGrantsFilter(
                name="ProductSKU",
                values=[""]
            )
            ]
        )
```

* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.

## Attributes Reference
