  Compose and decompose AWS service DNS names
---

# Data Source: aws_service

Use this data source to compose and decompose AWS service DNS names.

## Example Usage

### Get Service DNS Name

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_aws_region_current = aws.data_aws_region.DataAwsRegion(self, "current")
        aws.data_aws_service.DataAwsService(self, "test",
            region=cdktf.Token.as_string(data_aws_region_current.name),
            service_id="ec2"
        )
```

### Use Service Reverse DNS Name to Get Components

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_service.DataAwsService(self, "s3",
            reverse_dns_name="cn.com.amazonaws.cn-north-1.s3"
        )
```

### Determine Regional Support for a Service

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_service.DataAwsService(self, "s3",
            reverse_dns_name="com.amazonaws.us-gov-west-1.waf"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `dns_name` - (Optional) DNS name of the service (_e.g.,_ `rds.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). One of `dns_name`, `reverse_dns_name`, or `service_id` is required.
* `partition` - (Optional) Partition corresponding to the region.
* `region` - (Optional) Region of the service (_e.g.,_ `us-west-2`, `ap-northeast-1`).
* `reverse_dns_name` - (Optional) Reverse DNS name of the service (_e.g.,_ `com.amazonaws.us-west-2.s3`). One of `dns_name`, `reverse_dns_name`, or `service_id` is required.
* `reverse_dns_prefix` - (Optional) Prefix of the service (_e.g.,_ `com.amazonaws` in AWS Commercial, `cn.com.amazonaws` in AWS China).
* `service_id` - (Optional) Service (_e.g.,_ `s3`, `rds`, `ec2`). One of `dns_name`, `reverse_dns_name`, or `service_id` is required.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `supported` - Whether the service is supported in the region's partition. New services may not be listed immediately as supported.
