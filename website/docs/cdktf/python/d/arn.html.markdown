# Data Source: aws_arn

Parses an ARN into its constituent parts.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_arn.DataAwsArn(self, "db_instance",
            arn="arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:123456789012:db:mysql-db"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `arn` - (Required) ARN to parse.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `partition` - Partition that the resource is in.

* `service` - The [service namespace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces) that identifies the AWS product.

* `region` - Region the resource resides in.
Note that the ARNs for some resources do not require a region, so this component might be omitted.

* `account` - The [ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html) of the AWS account that owns the resource, without the hyphens.

* `resource` - Content of this part of the ARN varies by service.
It often includes an indicator of the type of resource—for example, an IAM user or Amazon RDS database —followed by a slash (/) or a colon (:), followed by the resource name itself.
