# Data Source: aws_dx_location

Retrieve information about a specific AWS Direct Connect location in the current AWS Region.
These are the locations that can be specified when configuring [`aws_dx_connection`](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_connection.html) or [`aws_dx_lag`](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_lag.html) resources.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_dx_location.DataAwsDxLocation(self, "example",
            location_code="CS32A-24FL"
        )
```
