## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the slot type. The name is case sensitive.
* `version` - (Optional) Version of the slot type.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported.

* `checksum` - Checksum identifying the version of the slot type that was created. The checksum is
not included as an argument because the resource will add it automatically when updating the slot type.
* `created_date` - Date when the slot type version was created.
* `description` - Description of the slot type.
* `enumeration_value` - Set of EnumerationValue objects that defines the values that
the slot type can take. Each value can have a set of synonyms, which are additional values that help
train the machine learning model about the values that it resolves for a slot.
* `last_updated_date` - Date when the $LATEST version of this slot type was updated.
* `name` - Name of the slot type. The name is not case sensitive.
* `value_selection_strategy` - Determines the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex
uses to return slot type values. `ORIGINAL_VALUE` returns the value entered by the user if the user
value is similar to the slot value. `TOP_RESOLUTION` returns the first value in the resolution list
if there is a resolution list for the slot, otherwise null is returned.
* `version` - Version of the slot type.
