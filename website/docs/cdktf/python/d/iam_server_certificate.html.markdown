# Data Source: aws_iam_server_certificate

Use this data source to lookup information about IAM Server Certificates.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_aws_iam_server_certificate_my_domain =
        aws.data_aws_iam_server_certificate.DataAwsIamServerCertificate(self, "my-domain",
            latest=True,
            name_prefix="my-domain.org"
        )
        aws.elb.Elb(self, "elb",
            listener=[ElbListener(
                instance_port=8000,
                instance_protocol="https",
                lb_port=443,
                lb_protocol="https",
                ssl_certificate_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(data_aws_iam_server_certificate_my_domain.arn)
            )
            ],
            name="my-domain-elb"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `name_prefix` - prefix of cert to filter by
* `path_prefix` - prefix of path to filter by
* `name` - exact name of the cert to lookup
* `latest` - sort results by expiration date. returns the certificate with expiration date in furthest in the future.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` is set to the unique id of the IAM Server Certificate
* `arn` is set to the ARN of the IAM Server Certificate
* `path` is set to the path of the IAM Server Certificate
* `expiration_date` is set to the expiration date of the IAM Server Certificate
* `upload_date` is the date when the server certificate was uploaded
* `certificate_body` is the public key certificate (PEM-encoded). This is useful when [configuring back-end instance authentication](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-create-https-ssl-load-balancer.html) policy for load balancer
* `certificate_chain` is the public key certificate chain (PEM-encoded) if exists, empty otherwise

## Import

The terraform import function will read in certificate body, certificate chain (if it exists), id, name, path, and arn.
It will not retrieve the private key which is not available through the AWS API.
