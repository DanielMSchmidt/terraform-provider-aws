## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
        #     You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables
        mount_target_id = cdktf.TerraformVariable(self, "mount_target_id",
            default="",
            type=cdktf.VariableType.STRING
        )
        aws.data_aws_efs_mount_target.DataAwsEfsMountTarget(self, "by_id",
            mount_target_id=mount_target_id.string_value
        )
```
