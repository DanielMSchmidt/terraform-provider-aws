# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_iam_user_ssh_key.DataAwsIamUserSshKey(self, "example",
            encoding="SSH",
            ssh_public_key_id="APKARUZ32GUTKIGARLXE",
            username="test-user"
