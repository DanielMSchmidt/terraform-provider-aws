  Get information about a set of IAM Users.

# Data Source: aws_iam_users

Use this data source to get the ARNs and Names of IAM Users.

## Example Usage

### All users in an account

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_iam_users.DataAwsIamUsers(self, "users")
```

### Users filtered by name regex

Users whose username contains `abc`

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_iam_users.DataAwsIamUsers(self, "users",
            name_regex=".*abc.*"
        )
```

### Users filtered by path prefix

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_iam_users.DataAwsIamUsers(self, "users",
            path_prefix="/custom-path"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name_regex` - (Optional) Regex string to apply to the IAM users list returned by AWS. This allows more advanced filtering not supported from the AWS API. This filtering is done locally on what AWS returns, and could have a performance impact if the result is large. Combine this with other options to narrow down the list AWS returns.
* `path_prefix` - (Optional) Path prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix `/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/` gets all users whose path starts with `/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/`. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (`/`), listing all users. For more details, check out [list-users in the AWS CLI reference][1].

## Attributes Reference

* `arns` - Set of ARNs of the matched IAM users.
* `names` - Set of Names of the matched IAM users.
