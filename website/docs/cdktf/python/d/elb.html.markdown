  Provides a classic Elastic Load Balancer data source.

# aws_elb

Provides information about a "classic" Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
See [LB Data Source](/docs/providers/aws/d/lb.html) if you are looking for "v2"
Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB).

This data source can prove useful when a module accepts an LB as an input
variable and needs to, for example, determine the security groups associated
with it, etc.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
        #     You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables
        lb_name = cdktf.TerraformVariable(self, "lb_name",
            default="",
            type=cdktf.VariableType.STRING
        )
        aws.data_aws_elb.DataAwsElb(self, "test",
            name=lb_name.string_value
        )
```
