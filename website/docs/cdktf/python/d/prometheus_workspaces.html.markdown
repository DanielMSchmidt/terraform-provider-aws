# Data Source: aws_prometheus_workspaces

Provides the aliases, ARNs, and workspace IDs of Amazon Prometheus workspaces.

## Example Usage

The following example returns all of the workspaces in a region:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_prometheus_workspaces.DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces(self, "example")
```

The following example filters the workspaces by alias. Only the workspaces with
aliases that begin with the value of `alias_prefix` will be returned:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_prometheus_workspaces.DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces(self, "example",
            alias_prefix="example"
        )
```

## Argument Reference
