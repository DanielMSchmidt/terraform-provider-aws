# Data Source: aws_eips

Provides a list of Elastic IPs in a region.

## Example Usage

The following shows outputting all Elastic IPs with the a specific tag value.

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_aws_eips_example = aws.data_aws_eips.DataAwsEips(self, "example",
            tags={
                "Env": "dev"
            }
        )
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "allocation_ids",
            value=data_aws_eips_example.allocation_ids
        )
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "public_ips",
            value=data_aws_eips_example.public_ips
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired Elastic IPs.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks, which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddresses.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field. An Elastic IP will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `allocation_ids` - List of all the allocation IDs for address for use with EC2-VPC.
* `public_ips` - List of all the Elastic IP addresses.
