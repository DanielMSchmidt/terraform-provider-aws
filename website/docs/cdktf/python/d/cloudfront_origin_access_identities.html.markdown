# Data Source: aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identities

Use this data source to get ARNs, ids and S3 canonical user IDs of Amazon CloudFront origin access identities.

## Example Usage

### All origin access identities in the account

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identities.DataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentities(self, "example")
```

### Origin access identities filtered by comment/name

Origin access identities whose comments are `example-comment1`, `example-comment2`

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.data_aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identities.DataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentities(self, "example",
            comments=["example-comment1", "example-comment2"]
        )
```

## Argument Reference
