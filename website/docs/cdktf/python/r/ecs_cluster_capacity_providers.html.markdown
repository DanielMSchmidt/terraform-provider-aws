  Provides an ECS cluster capacity providers resource.

# Resource: aws_ecs_cluster_capacity_providers

Manages the capacity providers of an ECS Cluster.

More information about capacity providers can be found in the [ECS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-capacity-providers.html).

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_ecs_cluster_example = aws.ecs_cluster.EcsCluster(self, "example",
            name="my-cluster"
        )
        aws_ecs_cluster_capacity_providers_example =
        aws.ecs_cluster_capacity_providers.EcsClusterCapacityProviders(self, "example_1",
            capacity_providers=["FARGATE"],
            cluster_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_ecs_cluster_example.name),
            default_capacity_provider_strategy=[EcsClusterCapacityProvidersDefaultCapacityProviderStrategy(
                base=1,
                capacity_provider="FARGATE",
                weight=100
            )
            ]
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_ecs_cluster_capacity_providers_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `capacity_providers` - (Optional) Set of names of one or more capacity providers to associate with the cluster. Valid values also include `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT`.
* `cluster_name` - (Required, Forces new resource) Name of the ECS cluster to manage capacity providers for.
* `default_capacity_provider_strategy` - (Optional) Set of capacity provider strategies to use by default for the cluster. Detailed below.

### default_capacity_provider_strategy Configuration Block

* `capacity_provider` - (Required) Name of the capacity provider.
* `weight` - (Optional) The relative percentage of the total number of launched tasks that should use the specified capacity provider. The `weight` value is taken into consideration after the `base` count of tasks has been satisfied. Defaults to `0`.
* `base` - (Optional) The number of tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base defined. Defaults to `0`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Same as `cluster_name`.

## Import

ECS cluster capacity providers can be imported using the `cluster_name` attribute. For example:

```
$ terraform import aws_ecs_cluster_capacity_providers.example my-cluster
```
