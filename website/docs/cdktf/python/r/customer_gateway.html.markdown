# Resource: aws_customer_gateway

Provides a customer gateway inside a VPC. These objects can be connected to VPN gateways via VPN connections, and allow you to establish tunnels between your network and the VPC.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.customer_gateway.CustomerGateway(self, "main",
            bgp_asn=cdktf.Token.as_string(65000),
            ip_address="172.83.124.10",
            tags={
                "Name": "main-customer-gateway"
            },
            type="ipsec.1"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bgp_asn` - (Required) The gateway's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN).
* `certificate_arn` - (Optional) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the customer gateway certificate.
* `device_name` - (Optional) A name for the customer gateway device.
* `ip_address` - (Optional) The IPv4 address for the customer gateway device's outside interface.
* `type` - (Required) The type of customer gateway. The only type AWS
  supports at this time is "ipsec.1".
* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to apply to the gateway. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The amazon-assigned ID of the gateway.
* `arn` - The ARN of the customer gateway.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

Customer Gateways can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_customer_gateway.main cgw-b4dc3961
```
