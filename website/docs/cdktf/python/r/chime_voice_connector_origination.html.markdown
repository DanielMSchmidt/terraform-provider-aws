# Resource: aws_chime_voice_connector_origination

Enable origination settings to control inbound calling to your SIP infrastructure.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_chime_voice_connector_default =
        aws.chime_voice_connector.ChimeVoiceConnector(self, "default",
            name="test",
            require_encryption=True
        )
        aws_chime_voice_connector_origination_default =
        aws.chime_voice_connector_origination.ChimeVoiceConnectorOrigination(self, "default_1",
            disabled=False,
            route=[ChimeVoiceConnectorOriginationRoute(
                host="127.0.0.1",
                port=8081,
                priority=1,
                protocol="TCP",
                weight=1
            ), ChimeVoiceConnectorOriginationRoute(
                host="127.0.0.2",
                port=8082,
                priority=2,
                protocol="TCP",
                weight=10
            )
            ],
            voice_connector_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_chime_voice_connector_default.id)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_chime_voice_connector_origination_default.override_logical_id("default")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `voice_connector_id` - (Required) The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.
* `route` - (Required) Set of call distribution properties defined for your SIP hosts. See [route](#route) below for more details. Minimum of 1. Maximum of 20.
* `disabled` - (Optional) When origination settings are disabled, inbound calls are not enabled for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

### `route`

Origination routes define call distribution properties for your SIP hosts to receive inbound calls using your Amazon Chime Voice Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes for each Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

* `host` - (Required) The FQDN or IP address to contact for origination traffic.
* `port` - (Required) The designated origination route port. Defaults to `5060`.
* `priority` - (Required) The priority associated with the host, with 1 being the highest priority. Higher priority hosts are attempted first.
* `protocol` - (Required) The protocol to use for the origination route. Encryption-enabled Amazon Chime Voice Connectors use TCP protocol by default.
* `weight` - (Required) The weight associated with the host. If hosts are equal in priority, calls are redistributed among them based on their relative weight.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.

## Import

Chime Voice Connector Origination can be imported using the `voice_connector_id`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_chime_voice_connector_origination.default abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4
```
