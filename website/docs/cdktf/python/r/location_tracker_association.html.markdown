# Resource: aws_location_tracker_association

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Location Tracker Association.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_location_geofence_collection_example =
        aws.location_geofence_collection.LocationGeofenceCollection(self, "example",
            collection_name="example"
        )
        aws_location_tracker_example = aws.location_tracker.LocationTracker(self, "example_1",
            tracker_name="example"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_location_tracker_example.override_logical_id("example")
        aws_location_tracker_association_example =
        aws.location_tracker_association.LocationTrackerAssociation(self, "example_2",
            consumer_arn=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_location_geofence_collection_example.collection_arn),
            tracker_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_location_tracker_example.tracker_name)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_location_tracker_association_example.override_logical_id("example")
```
