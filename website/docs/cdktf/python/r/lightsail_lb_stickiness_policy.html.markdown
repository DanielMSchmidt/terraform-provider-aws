# Resource: aws_lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy

Configures Session Stickiness for a Lightsail Load Balancer.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_lightsail_lb_test = aws.lightsail_lb.LightsailLb(self, "test",
            health_check_path="/",
            instance_port=cdktf.Token.as_number("80"),
            name="test-load-balancer",
            tags={
                "foo": "bar"
            }
        )
        aws_lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy_test =
        aws.lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy.LightsailLbStickinessPolicy(self, "test_1",
            cookie_duration=900,
            enabled=True,
            lb_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_lightsail_lb_test.name)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_lb_stickiness_policy_test.override_logical_id("test")
```

## Argument Reference

* `lb_name` - (Required) The name of the load balancer to which you want to enable session stickiness.
* `cookie_duration` - (Required) The cookie duration in seconds. This determines the length of the session stickiness.
* `enabled` - (Required) - The Session Stickiness state of the load balancer. `true` to activate session stickiness or `false` to deactivate session stickiness.

## Attributes Reference
