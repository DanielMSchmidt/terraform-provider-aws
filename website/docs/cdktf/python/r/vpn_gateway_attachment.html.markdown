# Resource: aws_vpn_gateway_attachment

Provides a Virtual Private Gateway attachment resource, allowing for an existing
hardware VPN gateway to be attached and/or detached from a VPC.

-> **Note:** The [`aws_vpn_gateway`](vpn_gateway.html)
resource can also automatically attach the Virtual Private Gateway it creates
to an existing VPC by setting the [`vpc_id`](vpn_gateway.html#vpc_id) attribute accordingly.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_vpc_network = aws.vpc.Vpc(self, "network",
            cidr_block="10.0.0.0/16"
        )
        aws_vpn_gateway_vpn = aws.vpn_gateway.VpnGateway(self, "vpn",
            tags={
                "Name": "example-vpn-gateway"
            }
        )
        aws.vpn_gateway_attachment.VpnGatewayAttachment(self, "vpn_attachment",
            vpc_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_vpc_network.id),
            vpn_gateway_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_vpn_gateway_vpn.id)
        )
```
