# Resource: aws_dx_gateway_association

Associates a Direct Connect Gateway with a VGW or transit gateway.

To create a cross-account association, create an [`aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_gateway_association_proposal.html)
in the AWS account that owns the VGW or transit gateway and then accept the proposal in the AWS account that owns the Direct Connect Gateway
by creating an `aws_dx_gateway_association` resource with the `proposal_id` and `associated_gateway_owner_account_id` attributes set.

## Example Usage

### VPN Gateway Association

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_dx_gateway_example = aws.dx_gateway.DxGateway(self, "example",
            amazon_side_asn="64512",
            name="example"
        )
        aws_vpc_example = aws.vpc.Vpc(self, "example_1",
            cidr_block="10.255.255.0/28"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_vpc_example.override_logical_id("example")
        aws_vpn_gateway_example = aws.vpn_gateway.VpnGateway(self, "example_2",
            vpc_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_vpc_example.id)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_vpn_gateway_example.override_logical_id("example")
        aws_dx_gateway_association_example =
        aws.dx_gateway_association.DxGatewayAssociation(self, "example_3",
            associated_gateway_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_vpn_gateway_example.id),
            dx_gateway_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_dx_gateway_example.id)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_dx_gateway_association_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

### Transit Gateway Association

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_dx_gateway_example = aws.dx_gateway.DxGateway(self, "example",
            amazon_side_asn="64512",
            name="example"
        )
        aws_ec2_transit_gateway_example =
        aws.ec2_transit_gateway.Ec2TransitGateway(self, "example_1")
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_ec2_transit_gateway_example.override_logical_id("example")
        aws_dx_gateway_association_example =
        aws.dx_gateway_association.DxGatewayAssociation(self, "example_2",
            allowed_prefixes=["10.255.255.0/30", "10.255.255.8/30"],
            associated_gateway_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_ec2_transit_gateway_example.id),
            dx_gateway_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_dx_gateway_example.id)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_dx_gateway_association_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

### Allowed Prefixes

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_dx_gateway_example = aws.dx_gateway.DxGateway(self, "example",
            amazon_side_asn="64512",
            name="example"
        )
        aws_vpc_example = aws.vpc.Vpc(self, "example_1",
            cidr_block="10.255.255.0/28"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_vpc_example.override_logical_id("example")
        aws_vpn_gateway_example = aws.vpn_gateway.VpnGateway(self, "example_2",
            vpc_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_vpc_example.id)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_vpn_gateway_example.override_logical_id("example")
        aws_dx_gateway_association_example =

            allowed_prefixes=["210.52.109.0/24", "175.45.176.0/22"],
            associated_gateway_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_vpn_gateway_example.id),
            dx_gateway_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_dx_gateway_example.id)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_dx_gateway_association_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

A full example of how to create a VPN Gateway in one AWS account, create a Direct Connect Gateway in a second AWS account, and associate the VPN Gateway with the Direct Connect Gateway via the `aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal` and `aws_dx_gateway_association` resources can be found in [the `./examples/dx-gateway-cross-account-vgw-association` directory within the Github Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/tree/main/examples/dx-gateway-cross-account-vgw-association).

## Argument Reference

~> **NOTE:** `dx_gateway_id` and `associated_gateway_id` must be specified for single account Direct Connect gateway associations.

The following arguments are supported:

* `dx_gateway_id` - (Required) The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.
* `associated_gateway_id` - (Optional) The ID of the VGW or transit gateway with which to associate the Direct Connect gateway.
Used for single account Direct Connect gateway associations.
* `associated_gateway_owner_account_id` - (Optional) The ID of the AWS account that owns the VGW or transit gateway with which to associate the Direct Connect gateway.
Used for cross-account Direct Connect gateway associations.
* `proposal_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association proposal.
Used for cross-account Direct Connect gateway associations.
* `allowed_prefixes` - (Optional) VPC prefixes (CIDRs) to advertise to the Direct Connect gateway. Defaults to the CIDR block of the VPC associated with the Virtual Gateway. To enable drift detection, must be configured.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association resource.
* `associated_gateway_type` - The type of the associated gateway, `transitGateway` or `virtualPrivateGateway`.
* `dx_gateway_association_id` - The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association.
* `dx_gateway_owner_account_id` - The ID of the AWS account that owns the Direct Connect gateway.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `create` - (Default `30m`)
- `update` - (Default `30m`)
- `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

Direct Connect gateway associations can be imported using `dx_gateway_id` together with `associated_gateway_id`,
e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_dx_gateway_association.example 345508c3-7215-4aef-9832-07c125d5bd0f/vgw-98765432
```
