# Resource: aws_lightsail_distribution

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Lightsail Distribution.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

Below is a basic example with a bucket as an origin.

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_lightsail_bucket_test = aws.lightsail_bucket.LightsailBucket(self, "test",
            bundle_id="small_1_0",
            name="test-bucket"
        )
        aws_lightsail_distribution_test =
        aws.lightsail_distribution.LightsailDistribution(self, "test_1",
            bundle_id="small_1_0",
            cache_behavior_settings=LightsailDistributionCacheBehaviorSettings(
                allowed_http_methods="GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE",
                cached_http_methods="GET,HEAD",

                maximum_ttl=31536000,
                minimum_ttl=0
            ),
            default_cache_behavior=LightsailDistributionDefaultCacheBehavior(
                behavior="cache"
            ),

                region_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_lightsail_bucket_test.region)
            )
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_distribution_test.override_logical_id("test")
```
