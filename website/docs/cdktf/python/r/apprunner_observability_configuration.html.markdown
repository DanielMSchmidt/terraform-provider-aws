# Resource: aws_apprunner_observability_configuration

Manages an App Runner Observability Configuration.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.apprunner_observability_configuration.ApprunnerObservabilityConfiguration(self, "example",
            observability_configuration_name="example",
            tags={
                "Name": "example-apprunner-observability-configuration"
            },
            trace_configuration=ApprunnerObservabilityConfigurationTraceConfiguration(
                vendor="AWSXRAY"
            )
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments supported:

* `observability_configuration_name` - (Required, Forces new resource) Name of the observability configuration.
* `trace_configuration` - (Optional) Configuration of the tracing feature within this observability configuration. If you don't specify it, App Runner doesn't enable tracing. See [Trace Configuration](#trace-configuration) below for more details.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### Trace Configuration

The `trace_configuration` block supports the following argument:

* `vendor` - (Required) Implementation provider chosen for tracing App Runner services. Valid values: `AWSXRAY`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of this observability configuration.
* `observability_configuration_revision` - The revision of this observability configuration.
* `latest` - Whether the observability configuration has the highest `observability_configuration_revision` among all configurations that share the same `observability_configuration_name`.
* `status` - Current state of the observability configuration. An INACTIVE configuration revision has been deleted and can't be used. It is permanently removed some time after deletion.
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

App Runner Observability Configuration can be imported by using the `arn`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_apprunner_observability_configuration.example "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:1234567890:observabilityconfiguration/example/1/d75bc7ea55b71e724fe5c23452fe22a1
```
