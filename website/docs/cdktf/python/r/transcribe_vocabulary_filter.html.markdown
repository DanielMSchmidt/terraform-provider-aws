# Resource: aws_transcribe_vocabulary_filter

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Transcribe VocabularyFilter.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.transcribe_vocabulary_filter.TranscribeVocabularyFilter(self, "example",
            language_code="en-US",
            tags={
                "tag1": "value1",
                "tag2": "value3"
            },
            vocabulary_filter_name="example",
            words=["cars", "bucket"]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `language_code` - (Required) The language code you selected for your vocabulary filter. Refer to the [supported languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html) page for accepted codes.

If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `words` - (Optional) - A list of terms to include in the vocabulary. Conflicts with `vocabulary_filter_file_uri` argument.

* `download_uri` - Generated download URI.
