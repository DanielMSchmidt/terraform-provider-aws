import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_customer_gateway_customer_gateway =
        aws.customer_gateway.CustomerGateway(self, "customer_gateway",
            bgp_asn=cdktf.Token.as_string(65000),
            ip_address="172.0.0.1",
            type="ipsec.1"
        )
        aws_vpc_vpc = aws.vpc.Vpc(self, "vpc",
            cidr_block="10.0.0.0/16"
        )
        aws_vpn_gateway_vpn_gateway = aws.vpn_gateway.VpnGateway(self, "vpn_gateway",
            vpc_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_vpc_vpc.id)
        )
        aws_vpn_connection_main = aws.vpn_connection.VpnConnection(self, "main",
            customer_gateway_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_customer_gateway_customer_gateway.id),
            static_routes_only=True,
            type="ipsec.1",
            vpn_gateway_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_vpn_gateway_vpn_gateway.id)
        )
