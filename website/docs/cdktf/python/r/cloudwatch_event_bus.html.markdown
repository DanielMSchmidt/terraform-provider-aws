# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_event_bus

Provides an EventBridge event bus resource.

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws.cloudwatch_event_bus.CloudwatchEventBus(self, "messenger",
            name="chat-messages"
        )
```

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_aws_cloudwatch_event_source_examplepartner =
        aws.data_aws_cloudwatch_event_source.DataAwsCloudwatchEventSource(self, "examplepartner",
            name_prefix="aws.partner/examplepartner.com"
        )
        aws_cloudwatch_event_bus_examplepartner =
        aws.cloudwatch_event_bus.CloudwatchEventBus(self, "examplepartner_1",
            event_source_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(data_aws_cloudwatch_event_source_examplepartner.name),
            name=cdktf.Token.as_string(data_aws_cloudwatch_event_source_examplepartner.name)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_cloudwatch_event_bus_examplepartner.override_logical_id("examplepartner")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the new event bus. The names of custom event buses can't contain the / character. To create a partner event bus, ensure the `name` matches the `event_source_name`.
* `event_source_name` (Optional) The partner event source that the new event bus will be matched with. Must match `name`.
* `tags` - (Optional)  A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event bus.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

EventBridge event buses can be imported using the `name` (which can also be a partner event source name), e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.messenger chat-messages
```
