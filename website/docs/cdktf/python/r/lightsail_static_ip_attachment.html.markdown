# Resource: aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment

Provides a static IP address attachment - relationship between a Lightsail static IP & Lightsail instance.

~> **Note:** Lightsail is currently only supported in a limited number of AWS Regions, please see ["Regions and Availability Zones in Amazon Lightsail"](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/overview/article/understanding-regions-and-availability-zones-in-amazon-lightsail) for more details

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_lightsail_instance_test =
        aws.lightsail_instance.LightsailInstance(self, "test",
            availability_zone="us-east-1b",
            blueprint_id="string",
            bundle_id="string",
            key_pair_name="some_key_name",
            name="example"
        )
        aws_lightsail_static_ip_test =
        aws.lightsail_static_ip.LightsailStaticIp(self, "test_1",
            name="example"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_static_ip_test.override_logical_id("test")
        aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment_test =
        aws.lightsail_static_ip_attachment.LightsailStaticIpAttachment(self, "test_2",
            instance_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_lightsail_instance_test.id),
            static_ip_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_lightsail_static_ip_test.id)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment_test.override_logical_id("test")
