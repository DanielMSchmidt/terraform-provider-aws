# Resource: aws_lightsail_lb_certificate

Creates a Lightsail load balancer Certificate resource.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_lightsail_lb_test = aws.lightsail_lb.LightsailLb(self, "test",
            health_check_path="/",
            instance_port=cdktf.Token.as_number("80"),
            name="test-load-balancer",
            tags={
                "foo": "bar"
            }
        )
        aws_lightsail_lb_certificate_test =
        aws.lightsail_lb_certificate.LightsailLbCertificate(self, "test_1",
            domain_name="test.com",
            lb_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(aws_lightsail_lb_test.id),
            name="test-load-balancer-certificate"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lightsail_lb_certificate_test.override_logical_id("test")
```

The following arguments are supported:

* `domain_name` - (Required) The domain name (e.g., example.com) for your SSL/TLS certificate.
* `lb_name` - (Required) The load balancer name where you want to create the SSL/TLS certificate.
* `name` - (Required) The SSL/TLS certificate name.
* `name` - (Required) The SSL/TLS certificate name.
* `subject_alternative_names` - (Optional) Set of domains that should be SANs in the issued certificate. `domain_name` attribute is automatically added as a Subject Alternative Name.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - A combination of attributes to create a unique id: `lb_name`,`name`
* `arn` - The ARN of the lightsail certificate.
* `created_at` - The timestamp when the instance was created.
* `domain_validation_options` - Set of domain validation objects which can be used to complete certificate validation. Can have more than one element, e.g., if SANs are defined.
