# Resource: aws_chime_voice_connector_group

Creates an Amazon Chime Voice Connector group under the administrator's AWS account. You can associate Amazon Chime Voice Connectors with the Amazon Chime Voice Connector group by including VoiceConnectorItems in the request.

You can include Amazon Chime Voice Connectors from different AWS Regions in your group. This creates a fault tolerant mechanism for fallback in case of availability events.
