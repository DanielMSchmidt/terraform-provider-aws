# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.aws as aws
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        aws_cloud9_environment_ec2_test =
        aws.cloud9_environment_ec2.Cloud9EnvironmentEc2(self, "test",
            instance_type="t2.micro",
            name="some-env"
