# Data Source: aws_security_groups

Use this data source to get IDs and VPC membership of Security Groups that are created outside of Terraform.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsSecurityGroups.DataAwsSecurityGroups(this, "test", {
      tags: {
        Application: "k8s",
        Environment: "dev",
      },
    });
  }
}

```

```terraform
data "aws_security_groups" "test" {
  filter {
    name   = "group-name"
    values = ["*nodes*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "vpc-id"
    values = [var.vpc_id]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match for desired security groups.
* `filter` - (Optional) One or more name/value pairs to use as filters. There are several valid keys, for a full reference, check out [describe-security-groups in the AWS CLI reference][1].

## Attributes Reference

* `arns` - ARNs of the matched security groups.
* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - IDs of the matches security groups.
* `vpcIds` - VPC IDs of the matched security groups. The data source's tag or filter *will span VPCs* unless the `vpcId` filter is also used.
