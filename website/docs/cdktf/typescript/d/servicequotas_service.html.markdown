/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsServicequotasService.DataAwsServicequotasService(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        serviceName: "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)",
      }
    );
  }
