# Data Source: aws_elastic_beanstalk_solution_stack

Use this data source to get the name of a elastic beanstalk solution stack.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsElasticBeanstalkSolutionStack.DataAwsElasticBeanstalkSolutionStack(
      this,
      "multi_docker",
      {
        mostRecent: true,
        nameRegex: "^64bit Amazon Linux (.*) Multi-container Docker (.*)$",
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `mostRecent` - (Optional) If more than one result is returned, use the most
recent solution stack.

* `nameRegex` - Regex string to apply to the solution stack list returned
by AWS. See [Elastic Beanstalk Supported Platforms][beanstalk-platforms] from
AWS documentation for reference solution stack names.

~> **NOTE:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search,
Terraform will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return
a single solution stack, or use `mostRecent` to choose the most recent one.

## Attributes Reference

* `name` - Name of the solution stack.
