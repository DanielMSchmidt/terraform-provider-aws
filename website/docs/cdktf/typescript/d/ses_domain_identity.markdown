# Data Source: aws_ses_domain_identity

Retrieve the SES domain identity

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsSesDomainIdentity.DataAwsSesDomainIdentity(this, "example", {
      domain: "example.com",
    });
  }
}

```

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of the domain identity.
* `domain` - Name of the domain
* `verificationToken` - Code which when added to the domain as a TXT record will signal to SES that the owner of the domain has authorized SES to act on their behalf.
