# Data Source: aws_licensemanager_received_licenses

This resource can be used to get a set of license ARNs matching a filter.

## Example Usage

The following shows getting all license ARNs issued from the AWS marketplace. Providing no filter, would provide all license ARNs for the entire account.

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicenses.DataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicenses(
      this,
      "test",
      {
        filter: [
          {
            name: "IssuerName",
            values: ["AWS/Marketplace"],
          },
        ],
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListReceivedLicenses.html#API_ListReceivedLicenses_RequestSyntax).
  For example, if filtering using `productSku`, use:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicenses.DataAwsLicensemanagerReceivedLicenses(
      this,
      "selected",
      {
        filter: [
          {
            name: "ProductSKU",
            values: [""],
          },
        ],
      }
    );
  }
}

```

* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.

## Attributes Reference

* `arns` - List of all the license ARNs found.
