# Data Source: aws_sfn_state_machine

Use this data source to get the ARN of a State Machine in AWS Step
Function (SFN). By using this data source, you can reference a
state machine without having to hard code the ARNs as input.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsSfnStateMachine.DataAwsSfnStateMachine(this, "example", {
      name: "an_example_sfn_name",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) Friendly name of the state machine to match.
