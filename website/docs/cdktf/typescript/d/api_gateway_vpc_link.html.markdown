# Data Source: aws_api_gateway_vpc_link

Use this data source to get the id of a VPC Link in
API Gateway. To fetch the VPC Link you must provide a name to match against.
As there is no unique name constraint on API Gateway VPC Links this data source will
error if there is more than one match.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsApiGatewayVpcLink.DataAwsApiGatewayVpcLink(
      this,
      "my_api_gateway_vpc_link",
      {
        name: "my-vpc-link",
      }
    );
  }
}

```
