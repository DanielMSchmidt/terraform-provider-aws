# Data Source: aws_api_gateway_resource

Use this data source to get the id of a Resource in API Gateway.
To fetch the Resource, you must provide the REST API id as well as the full path.  

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAwsApiGatewayRestApiMyRestApi =
      new aws.dataAwsApiGatewayRestApi.DataAwsApiGatewayRestApi(
        this,
        "my_rest_api",
        {
          name: "my-rest-api",
        }
      );
    new aws.dataAwsApiGatewayResource.DataAwsApiGatewayResource(
      this,
      "my_resource",
      {
        path: "/endpoint/path",
        restApiId: cdktf.Token.asString(dataAwsApiGatewayRestApiMyRestApi.id),
      }
    );
  }
}

```
