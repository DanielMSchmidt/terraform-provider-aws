## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
    You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables*/
    const mountTargetId = new cdktf.TerraformVariable(this, "mount_target_id", {
      default: "",
      type: cdktf.VariableType.STRING,
    });
    new aws.dataAwsEfsMountTarget.DataAwsEfsMountTarget(this, "by_id", {
      mountTargetId: mountTargetId.stringValue,
    });
  }
}

```
