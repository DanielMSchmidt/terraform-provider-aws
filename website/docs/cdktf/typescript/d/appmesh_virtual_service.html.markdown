# Data Source: aws_appmesh_virtual_service

The App Mesh Virtual Service data source allows details of an App Mesh Virtual Service to be retrieved by its name, mesh_name, and optionally the mesh_owner.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsAppmeshVirtualService.DataAwsAppmeshVirtualService(
      this,
      "test",
      {
        meshName: "example-mesh",
        name: "example.mesh.local",
      }
    );
  }
}

```

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent =
      new aws.dataAwsCallerIdentity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
    new aws.dataAwsAppmeshVirtualService.DataAwsAppmeshVirtualService(
      this,
      "test",
      {
        meshName: "example-mesh",
        meshOwner: cdktf.Token.asString(dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent.accountId),
        name: "example.mesh.local",
      }
    );
  }
}

```
