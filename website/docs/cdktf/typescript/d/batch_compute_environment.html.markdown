# Data Source: aws_batch_compute_environment

The Batch Compute Environment data source allows access to details of a specific
compute environment within AWS Batch.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsBatchComputeEnvironment.DataAwsBatchComputeEnvironment(
      this,
      "batch-mongo",
      {
        computeEnvironmentName: "batch-mongo-production",
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `computeEnvironmentName` - (Required) Name of the Batch Compute Environment

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of the compute environment.
* `ecsClusterArn` - ARN of the underlying Amazon ECS cluster used by the compute environment.
* `serviceRole` - ARN of the IAM role that allows AWS Batch to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf.
* `type` - Type of the compute environment (for example, `managed` or `unmanaged`).
* `status` - Current status of the compute environment (for example, `creating` or `valid`).
* `statusReason` - Short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the compute environment.
* `state` - State of the compute environment (for example, `enabled` or `disabled`). If the state is `enabled`, then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues.
* `tags` - Key-value map of resource tags
