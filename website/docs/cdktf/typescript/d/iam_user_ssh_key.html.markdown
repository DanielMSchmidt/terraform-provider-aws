import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsIamUserSshKey.DataAwsIamUserSshKey(this, "example", {
      encoding: "SSH",
      sshPublicKeyId: "APKARUZ32GUTKIGARLXE",
      username: "test-user",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference
