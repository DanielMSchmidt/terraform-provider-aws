# Data Source: aws_prometheus_workspaces

Provides the aliases, ARNs, and workspace IDs of Amazon Prometheus workspaces.

## Example Usage

The following example returns all of the workspaces in a region:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces.DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces(
      this,
      "example",
      {}
    );
  }
}

```

The following example filters the workspaces by alias. Only the workspaces with
aliases that begin with the value of `aliasPrefix` will be returned:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces.DataAwsPrometheusWorkspaces(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        aliasPrefix: "example",
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `aliasPrefix` - (Optional) Limits results to workspaces with aliases that begin with this value.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `aliases` - List of aliases of the matched Prometheus workspaces.
* `arns` - List of ARNs of the matched Prometheus workspaces.
* `workspaceIds` - List of workspace IDs of the matched Prometheus workspaces.
