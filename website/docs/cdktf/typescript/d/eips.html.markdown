# Data Source: aws_eips

Provides a list of Elastic IPs in a region.

## Example Usage

The following shows outputting all Elastic IPs with the a specific tag value.

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAwsEipsExample = new aws.dataAwsEips.DataAwsEips(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        tags: {
          Env: "dev",
        },
      }
    );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "allocation_ids", {
      value: dataAwsEipsExample.allocationIds,
    });
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "public_ips", {
      value: dataAwsEipsExample.publicIps,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired Elastic IPs.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks, which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddresses.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field. An Elastic IP will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `allocationIds` - List of all the allocation IDs for address for use with EC2-VPC.
* `publicIps` - List of all the Elastic IP addresses.
