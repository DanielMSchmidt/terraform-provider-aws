# Data Source: aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identities

Use this data source to get ARNs, ids and S3 canonical user IDs of Amazon CloudFront origin access identities.

## Example Usage

### All origin access identities in the account

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentities.DataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentities(
      this,
      "example",
      {}
    );
  }
}

```

### Origin access identities filtered by comment/name

Origin access identities whose comments are `exampleComment1`, `exampleComment2`

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.dataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentities.DataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentities(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        comments: ["example-comment1", "example-comment2"],
      }
    );
  }
}

```
