# Resource: aws_codedeploy_deployment_group

Provides a CodeDeploy Deployment Group for a CodeDeploy Application

~> **NOTE on blue/green deployments:** When using `greenFleetProvisioningOption` with the `copyAutoScalingGroup` action, CodeDeploy will create a new ASG with a different name. This ASG is _not_ managed by terraform and will conflict with existing configuration and state. You may want to use a different approach to managing deployments that involve multiple ASG, such as `discoverExisting` with separate blue and green ASG.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);

      }
    );
    const awsSnsTopicExample = new aws.snsTopic.SnsTopic(this, "example_1", {
      name: "example-topic",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsSnsTopicExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentAssumeRole =
      new aws.dataAwsIamPolicyDocument.DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(
        this,
        "assume_role",

_Only one `alarmConfiguration` is allowed_.

### auto_rollback_configuration Argument Reference

* `actionOnTimeout` - (Optional) When to reroute traffic from an original environment to a replacement environment in a blue/green deployment.
    * `continueDeployment`: Register new instances with the load balancer immediately after the new application revision is installed on the instances in the replacement environment.
    * `stopDeployment`: Do not register new instances with load balancer unless traffic is rerouted manually. If traffic is not rerouted manually before the end of the specified wait period, the deployment status is changed to Stopped.
* `waitTimeInMinutes` - (Optional) The number of minutes to wait before the status of a blue/green deployment changed to Stopped if rerouting is not started manually. Applies only to the `stopDeployment` option for `actionOnTimeout`.

You can configure how instances will be added to the replacement environment in a blue/green deployment. `greenFleetProvisioningOption` supports the following:

* `action` - (Optional) The method used to add instances to a replacement environment.
    * `discoverExisting`: Use instances that already exist or will be created manually.
    * `copyAutoScalingGroup`: Use settings from a specified **Auto Scaling** group to define and create instances in a new Auto Scaling group. _Exactly one Auto Scaling group must be specified_ when selecting `copyAutoScalingGroup`. Use `autoscalingGroups` to specify the Auto Scaling group.

You can configure how instances in the original environment are terminated when a blue/green deployment is successful. `terminateBlueInstancesOnDeploymentSuccess` supports the following:

* `action` - (Optional) The action to take on instances in the original environment after a successful blue/green deployment.
