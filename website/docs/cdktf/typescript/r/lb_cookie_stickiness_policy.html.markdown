```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const awsElbLb = new aws.elb.Elb(this, "lb", {
      availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
      listener: [
        {
          instancePort: 8000,
          instanceProtocol: "http",
          lbPort: 80,
          lbProtocol: "http",
        },
      ],
      name: "test-lb",
    });
    new aws.lbCookieStickinessPolicy.LbCookieStickinessPolicy(this, "foo", {
      cookieExpirationPeriod: 600,
      lbPort: 80,
      loadBalancer: cdktf.Token.asString(awsElbLb.id),
      name: "foo-policy",
    });
  }
