See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.worklinkFleet.WorklinkFleet(this, "example", {

    });
  }
}

```

Network Configuration Usage:

```terraform
resource "aws_worklink_fleet" "example" {

    vpc_id             = aws_vpc.test.id
    subnet_ids         = [aws_subnet.test[*].id]
    security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.test.id]
  }
}
```

Identity Provider Configuration Usage:
