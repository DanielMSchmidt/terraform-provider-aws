# Resource: aws_amplify_app

Provides an Amplify App resource, a fullstack serverless app hosted on the [AWS Amplify Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

~> **Note:** When you create/update an Amplify App from Terraform, you may end up with the error "BadRequestException: You should at least provide one valid token" because of authentication issues. See the section "Repository with Tokens" below.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.amplifyApp.AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      buildSpec:
        "version: 0.1\nfrontend:\n  phases:\n    preBuild:\n      commands:\n        - yarn install\n    build:\n      commands:\n        - yarn run build\n  artifacts:\n    baseDirectory: build\n    files:\n      - '**/*'\n  cache:\n    paths:\n      - node_modules/**/*\n",
      customRule: [
        {
          source: "/<*>",
          status: "404",
          target: "/index.html",
        },
      ],
      environmentVariables: {
        ENV: "test",
      },
      name: "example",
      repository: "https://github.com/example/app",
    });
  }
}

```

### Repository with Tokens

If you create a new Amplify App with the `repository` argument, you also need to set `oauthToken` or `accessToken` for authentication. For GitHub, get a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and set `accessToken` as follows:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.amplifyApp.AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      accessToken: "...",
      name: "example",
      repository: "https://github.com/example/app",
    });
  }
}

```

You can omit `accessToken` if you import an existing Amplify App created by the Amplify Console (using OAuth for authentication).

### Auto Branch Creation

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.amplifyApp.AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      autoBranchCreationConfig: {
        enableAutoBuild: true,
      },
      autoBranchCreationPatterns: ["*", "*/**"],
      enableAutoBranchCreation: true,
      name: "example",
    });
  }
}

```

### Basic Authorization

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.amplifyApp.AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      basicAuthCredentials: cdktf.Fn.base64encode("username1:password1"),
      enableBasicAuth: true,
      name: "example",
    });
  }
}

```

### Rewrites and Redirects

```terraform
resource "aws_amplify_app" "example" {
  name = "example"

  # Reverse Proxy Rewrite for API requests
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/redirects.html#reverse-proxy-rewrite
  custom_rule {
    source = "/api/<*>"
    status = "200"
    target = "https://api.example.com/api/<*>"
  }

  # Redirects for Single Page Web Apps (SPA)
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/redirects.html#redirects-for-single-page-web-apps-spa
  custom_rule {
    source = "</^[^.]+$|\\.(?!(css|gif|ico|jpg|js|png|txt|svg|woff|ttf|map|json)$)([^.]+$)/>"
    status = "200"
    target = "/index.html"
  }
}
```

### Custom Image

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.amplifyApp.AmplifyApp(this, "example", {
      environmentVariables: {
        _CUSTOM_IMAGE: "node:16",
      },
      name: "example",
    });
  }
}

```
