# Resource: aws_lightsail_domain

Creates a domain resource for the specified domain (e.g., example.com).
You cannot register a new domain name using Lightsail. You must register
a domain name using Amazon Route 53 or another domain name registrar.
If you have already registered your domain, you can enter its name in
this parameter to manage the DNS records for that domain.
