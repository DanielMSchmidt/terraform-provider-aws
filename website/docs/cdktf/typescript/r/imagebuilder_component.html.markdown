# Resource: aws_imagebuilder_component

Manages an Image Builder Component.

## Example Usage

### Inline Data Document

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.imagebuilderComponent.ImagebuilderComponent(this, "example", {
      data: cdktf.Fn.yamlencode({
        phases: [
          {
            name: "build",
            steps: [
              {
                action: "ExecuteBash",
                inputs: {
                  commands: ["echo 'hello world'"],
                },
                name: "example",
                onFailure: "Continue",
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
        schemaVersion: 1,
      }),
      name: "example",
      platform: "Linux",
      version: "1.0.0",
    });
  }
}

```

### URI Document

```terraform
resource "aws_imagebuilder_component" "example" {
  name     = "example"
  platform = "Linux"
  uri      = "s3://${aws_s3_object.example.bucket}/${aws_s3_object.example.key}"
  version  = "1.0.0"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the component.
* `platform` - (Required) Platform of the component.
* `version` - (Required) Version of the component.

The following attributes are optional:

* `changeDescription` - (Optional) Change description of the component.
* `data` - (Optional) Inline YAML string with data of the component. Exactly one of `data` and `uri` can be specified. Terraform will only perform drift detection of its value when present in a configuration.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the component.
* `kmsKeyId` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Service (KMS) Key used to encrypt the component.
* `skipDestroy` - (Optional) Whether to retain the old version when the resource is destroyed or replacement is necessary. Defaults to `false`.
* `supportedOsVersions` - (Optional) Set of Operating Systems (OS) supported by the component.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags for the component. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `uri` - (Optional) S3 URI with data of the component. Exactly one of `data` and `uri` can be specified.

~> **NOTE:** Updating `data` or `uri` requires specifying a new `version`. This causes replacement of the resource. The `skipDestroy` argument can be used to retain the old version.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the component.
* `dateCreated` - Date the component was created.
* `encrypted` - Encryption status of the component.
* `owner` - Owner of the component.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).
* `type` - Type of the component.

## Import

`awsImagebuilderComponents` resources can be imported by using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_imagebuilder_component.example arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1:123456789012:component/example/1.0.0/1
```

Certain resource arguments, such as `uri`, cannot be read via the API and imported into Terraform. Terraform will display a difference for these arguments the first run after import if declared in the Terraform configuration for an imported resource.
