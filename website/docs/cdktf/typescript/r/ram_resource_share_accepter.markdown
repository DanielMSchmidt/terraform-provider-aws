# Resource: aws_ram_resource_share_accepter

Manage accepting a Resource Access Manager (RAM) Resource Share invitation. From a _receiver_ AWS account, accept an invitation to share resources that were shared by a _sender_ AWS account. To create a resource share in the _sender_, see the [`awsRamResourceShare` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share.html).

~> **Note:** If both AWS accounts are in the same Organization and [RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs), this resource is not necessary as RAM Resource Share invitations are not used.

## Example Usage

This configuration provides an example of using multiple Terraform AWS providers to configure two different AWS accounts. In the _sender_ account, the configuration creates a `awsRamResourceShare` and uses a data source in the _receiver_ account to create a `awsRamPrincipalAssociation` resource with the _receiver's_ account ID. In the _receiver_ account, the configuration accepts the invitation to share resources with the `awsRamResourceShareAccepter`.

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.provider.AwsProvider(this, "aws", {
      profile: "profile2",
    });
    const awsAlternate = new aws.provider.AwsProvider(this, "aws_1", {
      alias: "alternate",
      profile: "profile1",
    });
    const awsRamResourceShareSenderShare =
      new aws.ramResourceShare.RamResourceShare(this, "sender_share", {
        allowExternalPrincipals: true,
        name: "tf-test-resource-share",
        provider: awsAlternate,
        tags: {
          Name: "tf-test-resource-share",
        },
      });
    const dataAwsCallerIdentityReceiver =
      new aws.dataAwsCallerIdentity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "receiver", {});
    const awsRamPrincipalAssociationSenderInvite =
      new aws.ramPrincipalAssociation.RamPrincipalAssociation(
        this,
        "sender_invite",
        {
          principal: cdktf.Token.asString(
            dataAwsCallerIdentityReceiver.accountId
          ),
          provider: awsAlternate,
          resourceShareArn: cdktf.Token.asString(
            awsRamResourceShareSenderShare.arn
          ),
        }
      );
    new aws.ramResourceShareAccepter.RamResourceShareAccepter(
      this,
      "receiver_accept",
      {
        shareArn: cdktf.Token.asString(
          awsRamPrincipalAssociationSenderInvite.resourceShareArn
        ),
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `shareArn` - (Required) The ARN of the resource share.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `invitationArn` - The ARN of the resource share invitation.
* `shareId` - The ID of the resource share as displayed in the console.
* `status` - The status of the resource share (ACTIVE, PENDING, FAILED, DELETING, DELETED).
* `receiverAccountId` - The account ID of the receiver account which accepts the invitation.
* `senderAccountId` - The account ID of the sender account which submits the invitation.
* `shareName` - The name of the resource share.
* `resources` - A list of the resource ARNs shared via the resource share.

## Import

Resource share accepters can be imported using the resource share ARN, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_ram_resource_share_accepter.example arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/c4b56393-e8d9-89d9-6dc9-883752de4767
```
