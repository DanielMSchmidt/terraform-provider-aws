# Resource: aws_cloudtrail

Provides a CloudTrail resource.

-> **Tip:** For a multi-region trail, this resource must be in the home region of the trail.

-> **Tip:** For an organization trail, this resource must be in the master account of the organization.

## Example Usage

### Basic

Enable CloudTrail to capture all compatible management events in region.
For capturing events from services like IAM, `includeGlobalServiceEvents` must be enabled.

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const awsS3BucketFoo = new aws.s3Bucket.S3Bucket(this, "foo", {
      bucket: "tf-test-trail",
      forceDestroy: true,
    });
    const dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent =
      new aws.dataAwsCallerIdentity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
    const dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentFoo =
      new aws.dataAwsIamPolicyDocument.DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(this, "foo_2", {
        statement: [
          {
            actions: ["s3:GetBucketAcl"],
            effect: "Allow",
            principals: [
              {
                identifiers: ["cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"],
                type: "Service",
              },
            ],
            resources: [cdktf.Token.asString(awsS3BucketFoo.arn)],
            sid: "AWSCloudTrailAclCheck",
          },
          {
            actions: ["s3:PutObject"],
            condition: [
              {
                test: "StringEquals",
                values: ["bucket-owner-full-control"],
                variable: "s3:x-amz-acl",
              },
            ],
            effect: "Allow",
            principals: [
              {
                identifiers: ["cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"],
                type: "Service",
              },
            ],
            resources: [
              "${" +
                awsS3BucketFoo.arn +
                "}/prefix/AWSLogs/${" +
                dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent.accountId +
                "}/*",
            ],
            sid: "AWSCloudTrailWrite",
          },
        ],
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentFoo.overrideLogicalId("foo");
    new aws.cloudtrail.Cloudtrail(this, "foobar", {
      includeGlobalServiceEvents: false,
      name: "tf-trail-foobar",
      s3BucketName: cdktf.Token.asString(awsS3BucketFoo.id),
      s3KeyPrefix: "prefix",
    });
    const awsS3BucketPolicyFoo = new aws.s3BucketPolicy.S3BucketPolicy(
      this,
      "foo_4",
      {
        bucket: cdktf.Token.asString(awsS3BucketFoo.id),
        policy: cdktf.Token.asString(dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentFoo.json),
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsS3BucketPolicyFoo.overrideLogicalId("foo");
  }
}

```

### Data Event Logging

CloudTrail can log [Data Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html) for certain services such as S3 objects and Lambda function invocations. Additional information about data event configuration can be found in the following links:

* [CloudTrail API DataResource documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_DataResource.html) (for basic event selector).
* [CloudTrail API AdvancedFieldSelector documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedFieldSelector.html) (for advanced event selector).

#### Logging All Lambda Function Invocations By Using Basic Event Selectors

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::Lambda::Function"
      values = ["arn:aws:lambda"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logging All S3 Object Events By Using Basic Event Selectors

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::S3::Object"
      values = ["arn:aws:s3"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logging Individual S3 Bucket Events By Using Basic Event Selectors

```terraform
data "aws_s3_bucket" "important-bucket" {
  bucket = "important-bucket"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type = "AWS::S3::Object"

      # Make sure to append a trailing '/' to your ARN if you want
      # to monitor all objects in a bucket.
      values = ["${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket.arn}/"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logging All S3 Object Events Except For Two S3 Buckets By Using Advanced Event Selectors

```terraform
data "aws_s3_bucket" "not-important-bucket-1" {
  bucket = "not-important-bucket-1"
}

data "aws_s3_bucket" "not-important-bucket-2" {
  bucket = "not-important-bucket-2"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  advanced_event_selector {
    name = "Log all S3 objects events except for two S3 buckets"

    field_selector {
      field  = "eventCategory"
      equals = ["Data"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field = "resources.ARN"

      not_starts_with = [
        "${data.aws_s3_bucket.not-important-bucket-1.arn}/",
        "${data.aws_s3_bucket.not-important-bucket-2.arn}/"
      ]
    }

    field_selector {
      field  = "resources.type"
      equals = ["AWS::S3::Object"]
    }
  }

  advanced_event_selector {
    name = "Log readOnly and writeOnly management events"

    field_selector {
      field  = "eventCategory"
      equals = ["Management"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logging Individual S3 Buckets And Specific Event Names By Using Advanced Event Selectors

```terraform
data "aws_s3_bucket" "important-bucket-1" {
  bucket = "important-bucket-1"
}

data "aws_s3_bucket" "important-bucket-2" {
  bucket = "important-bucket-2"
}

data "aws_s3_bucket" "important-bucket-3" {
  bucket = "important-bucket-3"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  advanced_event_selector {
    name = "Log PutObject and DeleteObject events for two S3 buckets"

    field_selector {
      field  = "eventCategory"
      equals = ["Data"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field = "eventName"

      equals = [
        "PutObject",
        "DeleteObject"
      ]
    }

    field_selector {
      field = "resources.ARN"

      #The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it.
      equals = [
        "${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket-1.arn}/",
        "${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket-2.arn}/"
      ]
    }

    field_selector {
      field  = "readOnly"
      equals = ["false"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field  = "resources.type"
      equals = ["AWS::S3::Object"]
    }
  }

  advanced_event_selector {
    name = "Log Delete* events for one S3 bucket"

    field_selector {
      field  = "eventCategory"
      equals = ["Data"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field       = "eventName"
      starts_with = ["Delete"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field = "resources.ARN"

      #The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it.
      equals = [
        "${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket-3.arn}/important-prefix"
      ]
    }

    field_selector {
      field  = "readOnly"
      equals = ["false"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field  = "resources.type"
      equals = ["AWS::S3::Object"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Sending Events to CloudWatch Logs

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "example" {
  name = "Example"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  cloud_watch_logs_group_arn = "${aws_cloudwatch_log_group.example.arn}:*" # CloudTrail requires the Log Stream wildcard
}
```
