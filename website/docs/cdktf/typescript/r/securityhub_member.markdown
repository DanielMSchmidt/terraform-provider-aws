# Resource: aws_securityhub_member

Provides a Security Hub member resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";

        dependsOn: [awsSecurityhubAccountExample],
        email: "example@example.com",
