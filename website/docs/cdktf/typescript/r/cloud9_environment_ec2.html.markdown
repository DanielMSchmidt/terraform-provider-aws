# Resource: aws_cloud9_environment_ec2

Provides a Cloud9 EC2 Development Environment.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.cloud9EnvironmentEc2.Cloud9EnvironmentEc2(this, "example", {
      instanceType: "t2.micro",
      name: "example-env",
    });
  }
}

```

Get the URL of the Cloud9 environment after creation:

```terraform
resource "aws_cloud9_environment_ec2" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

data "aws_instance" "cloud9_instance" {
  filter {
    name = "tag:aws:cloud9:environment"
    values = [
    aws_cloud9_environment_ec2.example.id]
  }
}

output "cloud9_url" {
  value = "https://${var.region}.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/ide/${aws_cloud9_environment_ec2.example.id}"
}
```

Allocate a static IP to the Cloud9 environment:

```terraform
resource "aws_cloud9_environment_ec2" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

data "aws_instance" "cloud9_instance" {
  filter {
    name = "tag:aws:cloud9:environment"
    values = [
    aws_cloud9_environment_ec2.example.id]
  }
}

resource "aws_eip" "cloud9_eip" {
  instance = data.aws_instance.cloud9_instance.id
  domain   = "vpc"
}

output "cloud9_public_ip" {
  value = aws_eip.cloud9_eip.public_ip
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the environment.
* `instanceType` - (Required) The type of instance to connect to the environment, e.g., `t2Micro`.
* `automaticStopTimeMinutes` - (Optional) The number of minutes until the running instance is shut down after the environment has last been used.
* `connectionType` - (Optional) The connection type used for connecting to an Amazon EC2 environment. Valid values are `connectSsh` and `connectSsm`. For more information please refer [AWS documentation for Cloud9](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/ec2-ssm.html).
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the environment.
* `imageId` - (Optional) The identifier for the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that's used to create the EC2 instance. Valid values are
    * `amazonlinux1X8664`
    * `amazonlinux2X8664`
    * `ubuntu1804X8664`
    * `resolve:ssm:/aws/service/cloud9/amis/amazonlinux1X8664`
    * `resolve:ssm:/aws/service/cloud9/amis/amazonlinux2X8664`
    * `resolve:ssm:/aws/service/cloud9/amis/ubuntu1804X8664`
* `ownerArn` - (Optional) The ARN of the environment owner. This can be ARN of any AWS IAM principal. Defaults to the environment's creator.
* `subnetId` - (Optional) The ID of the subnet in Amazon VPC that AWS Cloud9 will use to communicate with the Amazon EC2 instance.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

* `id` - The ID of the environment.
* `arn` - The ARN of the environment.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).
* `type` - The type of the environment (e.g., `ssh` or `ec2`)
