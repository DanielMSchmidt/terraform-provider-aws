Provides an SSM Maintenance Window Target resource

## Example Usage

### Instance Target

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const awsSsmMaintenanceWindowWindow =
      new aws.ssmMaintenanceWindow.SsmMaintenanceWindow(this, "window", {
        cutoff: 1,
        duration: 3,
        name: "maintenance-window-webapp",
        schedule: "cron(0 16 ? * TUE *)",
      });
    new aws.ssmMaintenanceWindowTarget.SsmMaintenanceWindowTarget(
      this,
      "target1",
      {
        description: "This is a maintenance window target",
        name: "maintenance-window-target",
        resourceType: "INSTANCE",
        targets: [
          {
            key: "tag:Name",
            values: ["acceptance_test"],
          },
        ],
        windowId: cdktf.Token.asString(awsSsmMaintenanceWindowWindow.id),
      }
    );
  }
}

```

### Resource Group Target

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const awsSsmMaintenanceWindowWindow =
      new aws.ssmMaintenanceWindow.SsmMaintenanceWindow(this, "window", {
        cutoff: 1,
        duration: 3,
        name: "maintenance-window-webapp",
        schedule: "cron(0 16 ? * TUE *)",
      });
    new aws.ssmMaintenanceWindowTarget.SsmMaintenanceWindowTarget(
      this,
      "target1",
      {
        description: "This is a maintenance window target",
        name: "maintenance-window-target",
        resourceType: "RESOURCE_GROUP",
        targets: [
          {
            key: "resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters",
            values: ["AWS::EC2::Instance"],
          },
        ],
        windowId: cdktf.Token.asString(awsSsmMaintenanceWindowWindow.id),
      }
    );
  }
}

```
