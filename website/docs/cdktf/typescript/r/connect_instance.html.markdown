# Resource: aws_connect_instance

Provides an Amazon Connect instance resource. For more information see
[Amazon Connect: Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-get-started.html)

!> **WARN:** Amazon Connect enforces a limit of [100 combined instance creation and deletions every 30 days](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#feature-limits).  For example, if you create 80 instances and delete 20 of them, you must wait 30 days to create or delete another instance.  Use care when creating or deleting instances.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.connectInstance.ConnectInstance(this, "test", {
      identityManagementType: "CONNECT_MANAGED",
      inboundCallsEnabled: true,
      instanceAlias: "friendly-name-connect",
      outboundCallsEnabled: true,
    });
  }
}

```

## Example Usage with Existing Active Directory

```terraform
resource "aws_connect_instance" "test" {
  directory_id             = aws_directory_service_directory.test.id
  identity_management_type = "EXISTING_DIRECTORY"
  inbound_calls_enabled    = true
  instance_alias           = "friendly-name-connect"
  outbound_calls_enabled   = true
}
```

## Example Usage with SAML

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.connectInstance.ConnectInstance(this, "test", {
      identityManagementType: "SAML",
      inboundCallsEnabled: true,
      instanceAlias: "friendly-name-connect",
      outboundCallsEnabled: true,
    });
  }
}

```
