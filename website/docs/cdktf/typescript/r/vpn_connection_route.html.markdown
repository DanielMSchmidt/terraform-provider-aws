Provides a static route between a VPN connection and a customer gateway.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const awsCustomerGatewayCustomerGateway =
      new aws.customerGateway.CustomerGateway(this, "customer_gateway", {
        bgpAsn: cdktf.Token.asString(65000),
        ipAddress: "172.0.0.1",
        type: "ipsec.1",
      });
    const awsVpcVpc = new aws.vpc.Vpc(this, "vpc", {
      cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16",
    });
    const awsVpnGatewayVpnGateway = new aws.vpnGateway.VpnGateway(
      this,
      "vpn_gateway",
      {
        vpcId: cdktf.Token.asString(awsVpcVpc.id),
      }
    );
    const awsVpnConnectionMain = new aws.vpnConnection.VpnConnection(
      this,
      "main",
      {
        customerGatewayId: cdktf.Token.asString(
          awsCustomerGatewayCustomerGateway.id
        ),
        staticRoutesOnly: true,
        type: "ipsec.1",
        vpnGatewayId: cdktf.Token.asString(awsVpnGatewayVpnGateway.id),
      }
    );
    new aws.vpnConnectionRoute.VpnConnectionRoute(this, "office", {
      destinationCidrBlock: "192.168.10.0/24",
      vpnConnectionId: cdktf.Token.asString(awsVpnConnectionMain.id),
    });
  }
}
