# Resource: aws_chime_voice_connector_termination_credentials

Adds termination SIP credentials for the specified Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

~> **Note:** Voice Connector Termination Credentials requires a [Voice Connector Termination](/docs/providers/aws/r/chime_voice_connector_termination.html) to be present. Use of `dependsOn` (as shown below) is recommended to avoid race conditions.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const awsChimeVoiceConnectorDefault =
      new aws.chimeVoiceConnector.ChimeVoiceConnector(this, "default", {
        name: "test",
        requireEncryption: true,
      });
    const awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationDefault =
      new aws.chimeVoiceConnectorTermination.ChimeVoiceConnectorTermination(
        this,
        "default_1",
        {
          callingRegions: ["US", "CA"],
          cidrAllowList: ["50.35.78.96/31"],
          cpsLimit: 1,
          disabled: true,
          voiceConnectorId: cdktf.Token.asString(
            awsChimeVoiceConnectorDefault.id
          ),
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationDefault.overrideLogicalId("default");
    const awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentialsDefault =
      new aws.chimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentials.ChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentials(
        this,
        "default_2",
        {
          credentials: [
            {
              password: "test!",
              username: "test",
            },
          ],
          dependsOn: [awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationDefault],
          voiceConnectorId: cdktf.Token.asString(
            awsChimeVoiceConnectorDefault.id
          ),
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentialsDefault.overrideLogicalId(
      "default"
    );
  }
}

```
