# Resource: aws_appstream_fleet_stack_association

Manages an AppStream Fleet Stack association.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const awsAppstreamFleetExample = new aws.appstreamFleet.AppstreamFleet(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        computeCapacity: {
          desiredInstances: 1,
        },
        imageName: "Amazon-AppStream2-Sample-Image-02-04-2019",
        instanceType: "stream.standard.small",
        name: "NAME",
      }
    );
    const awsAppstreamStackExample = new aws.appstreamStack.AppstreamStack(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        name: "STACK NAME",
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsAppstreamStackExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const awsAppstreamFleetStackAssociationExample =
      new aws.appstreamFleetStackAssociation.AppstreamFleetStackAssociation(
        this,
        "example_2",
        {
          fleetName: cdktf.Token.asString(awsAppstreamFleetExample.name),
          stackName: cdktf.Token.asString(awsAppstreamStackExample.name),
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsAppstreamFleetStackAssociationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```
