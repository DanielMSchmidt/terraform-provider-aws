## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.auditmanagerAccountRegistration.AuditmanagerAccountRegistration(
      this,
      "example",
      {}
    );
  }
}

```

### Deregister On Destroy

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new aws.auditmanagerAccountRegistration.AuditmanagerAccountRegistration(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        deregisterOnDestroy: true,
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `delegatedAdminAccount` - (Optional) Identifier for the delegated administrator account.
* `deregisterOnDestroy` - (Optional) Flag to deregister AuditManager in the account upon destruction. Defaults to `false` (ie. AuditManager will remain active in the account, even if this resource is removed).
* `kmsKey` - (Optional) KMS key identifier.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Unique identifier for the account registration. Since registration is applied per AWS region, this will be the active region name (ex. `usEast1`).
* `status` - Status of the account registration request.

## Import

Audit Manager Account Registration resources can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_auditmanager_account_registration.example us-east-1
```
